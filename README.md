The dashboard gives a sales manager an overall look on the the last sales over the years. They can easliy track where the shop's future sales are going to be in the near future. The graphs provide information about the bestseller products, and geographical locations where do the most sales are going. So they can get these insights out of the data:

1. What producst are the most sold ones over the last year, so what product do they need to focus and get more for this year.
2. See the correlation between the geographical location and the category of the product which was sold most, so they will provide the particular place with the correct product.
3. THey can see the correlation of the 3 main KPIs: Geographical distribution, yearly trends and demand for the given category. These will help managers to control the ration between the demand and supply of the market and provide correct products to the correct places to get the highest profit margin.
