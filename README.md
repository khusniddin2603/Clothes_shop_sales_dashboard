This Beginner level dashboard showcases the trends, gender ratios and geograpical and category based distributions of the local Indian clothes shop.
This project dashboard is built to show my Excel Skills such as:  
1. Power Query for Data Cleaning
2. Visual graphs
3. Pivot Tables
4. Slicers
5. Data Validation tools

## Power Query to clean and optimize data

### These are the queries used:

* This graph helps managers to track what is the sales over the last year and they can decide depending on the values of the months. e.g They can provide more products on the months such as January, Februrary and March because these months were the most sales active months.
* Values were optimized in a such a format to make it easier to read.

### Distribution of the product categories:

The graph gives the visualisation of the ratio of products sold. These decisions/insights can be extracted of this graph:
1. Kurta and Set were the most sold products, so increasing the supply by the calculated amounts would increase profit, but there can be another reason for the given suggestion. Those 2 products might be the most supplied products and there might be shortage in other products so the low supply caused the low sales instead of low demand.
2. Managers can track the demand for the products and decide wether they are supplying correct product in correct amounts.
3. Slicers can be used to easily contrast the values between 2 products.



### Geographicla Visualisation And Data Validation Tool:  
This graph can be used to track the distribution of the sales between the regions.

Choosing the region using data validation tool will provide these advantages:
* Incorrect and incosistent values are prevented
* Gives the clean and not messed data and values


Overall, all the cells were locked so the any incorrect change and false result is prevented.


Conclusion:
The dashboard gives a sales manager an overall look on the the last sales over the years. They can easliy track where the shop's future sales are going to be in the near future. The graphs provide information about the bestseller products, and geographical locations where do the most sales are going. So they can get these insights out of the data:

1. What producst are the most sold ones over the last year, so what product do they need to focus and get more for this year.
2. See the correlation between the geographical location and the category of the product which was sold most, so they will provide the particular place with the correct product.
3. They can see the correlation of the 3 main KPIs: Geographical distribution, yearly trends and demand for the given category. These will help managers to control the ratio between the demand and supply of the market and provide correct products to the correct places to get the highest profit margin.
